        /* The following method will return a set of objects using an Expression filter (similar to a WHERE clause in SQL)

        Func<T, bool> represents a function that takes an object of generic type T and returns a bool on whether filter exists or not*

        Expression<Func<T>> is a description of a function as an expression tree.

        https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/advanced-topics/expression-trees/expression-trees-explained

        The expression is commonly referred to as a predicate and is used to verify a condition on an object.

        *The advantage is that Func<T> can be evaluated and compiled at run time and translated to other languages e.g. SQL in LINQ to SQL.

        trackChanges is used to flag whether we want EF to help track changes between read and write (tracking is normally set to true, but adds additional overhead, so if we do not need to track changes, we set to false)

        Includes will be used similarly to a SQL JOIN to “connect and relate to” other objects (PK-FK)
